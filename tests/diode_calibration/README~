Calibration of the pin diode
1. Measuring the diode current, at a given X-ray tube voltage
 	(5 different tube currents and with the diode in central position , for example:  2 cm, 40 kV, 40 and 50 mA).
		Diode Current [uA]= 9.8 Dose rate [Mrad/hr]
2. For each of these, the dose rate is obtained by the calibration curve of the diode.
3. A fit is then done, to obtain the dose rate at any tube current.
4. The procedure is repeated for different voltages and at different distances from the beam spot (distances of 3, 5 and 8 cm)
			The measurements have been done with/without Al filter (0.15  mm)
