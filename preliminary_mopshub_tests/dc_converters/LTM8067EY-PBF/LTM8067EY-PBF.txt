Needed output voltage  2.57 V 
Some updates shown up: 
The resistance of the type II cable is 138 立/km. As a result;
 
for Cables: 12-15 m , R will range between 1.656-2.07 立
The whole calculations will be as follow : 
1. From US15-PP3: Nothing changed in the current plan 

2. From US15-PP0:
	Cables: AWG20+ AWG26+AWG26+AWG32

	Corresponding R: 2.064+8.28+2.07+2.224

	Wire resistance = 9.386 - 14.638 立

	Total resistance (Back and forth)= 18.772 -29.276 立

If two MoPs are connected  (each with 35 mA) then:
		Voltage drop = 29.276 x 0.07 =2.049 V

The number 2.57 should change to a higher value (2.049+1.5 = 3.55 V) lets say 3.6V
